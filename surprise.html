        <h2>My love,</h2>
        <p>A whole website for you can never run out of style😚. As you read this, I presume a song is playing at the background. It has been our favourite so allow me to rededicate it to you with so much love❤️. Second, I hope you notice the gradient blue vs pink to stand for our favourite colours😍.</p>

        <p>So sweetheart, date 16 is heree🥳🥳. I hope you are excited just like I am. You'd think it's my birthday. So long as I am in your life I will always make a big deal on 16th Feb every year. Every time I stare in your eyes I find comfort. As I find it I also see a strong resilient boy who can do anything. He can play any instrument. Likeee boy youu so talented and I hope you know that.You are so smart, so kind and I hope you always see that in you. I pray people will never take advantage of your kindness. We've been through so much and if we made it this far we can marry🥰😂. If you have me I am going to have you forever. Sounds like a threat but this is me praying that I am always going to be by your side. AMEN.</p>

        <p>You are turning 23 and it's probably going to come with a lot. I pray that you may have wisdom to navigate anything in this new year. Wait... 23 is a lot of years and sweetie you are olddd!😂😂 Jokes jokes😂. I wish you nothing but a good life, may God shower you with his blessings. I see the way you serve him and I can tell you he won't fail you. NEVER my baby. May that wide smile, loud laughter and soft giggles never fade. When life toughens up may you remember that you can talk to me, you can cry in my arms, you can lean on my shoulder. When life is full of chaos pray and come to me for a very tight hug cos I'm gonna be there through thick and thin. I pray I get to type "HAPPY 60TH BIRTHDAY MY LOVE" to you one day. I hope you know how much joy and peace you bring in my life. You do so much for me and I notice it, I appreciate it wholeheartedly. As I always say, may your pockets never run dry. I'm afraid if I continue writing I won't stop so lemme end here. I hope you feel my love in each and every sentence as you read.</p>
